                    <h4>Bala Kanda (Book of Youth)</h4>
                    <p>The Ramayana begins with the birth of Rama and his three brothers to King Dasharatha of Ayodhya. Rama is the eldest and is known for his valor and virtues. The sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to the forest to protect his yajna (sacrificial ritual) from demons. During this time, Rama wins the hand of Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, by lifting and breaking the bow of Shiva at her swayamvara (a ceremony of choosing a husband).</p>
                    <h4>Ayodhya Kanda (Book of Ayodhya)</h4>
                    <p>King Dasharatha decides to crown Rama as the prince regent, but his plans are thwarted by his youngest queen, Kaikeyi. Influenced by her maid Manthara, Kaikeyi demands that her son Bharata be crowned king and that Rama be exiled to the forest for fourteen years. Bound by his promise to Kaikeyi, Dasharatha reluctantly agrees. Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana, willingly goes into exile.</p>
                    <h4>Aranya Kanda (Book of the Forest)</h4>
                    <p>During their exile, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana live in the forests, meeting sages and encountering various demons. Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, hears about Sita’s beauty and devises a plan to abduct her. He sends the demon Maricha, who disguises himself as a golden deer to lure Rama and Lakshmana away from their hermitage. Ravana then kidnaps Sita and takes her to his kingdom in Lanka.</p>
                    <h4>Kishkindha Kanda (Book of Kishkindha)</h4>
                    <p>Rama and Lakshmana search for Sita and meet Hanuman and Sugriva, the monkey king of Kishkindha. Sugriva promises to help Rama in exchange for his assistance in reclaiming his kingdom from his brother Vali. Rama kills Vali, and Sugriva becomes the king. The monkeys, led by Hanuman, begin their search for Sita.</p>
                    <h4>Sundara Kanda (Book of Beauty)</h4>
                    <p>Hanuman leaps across the ocean to Lanka, where he finds Sita in the Ashoka Vatika, guarded by Ravana’s demonesses. He gives her Rama’s ring as a token and assures her that Rama will come to rescue her. Hanuman causes havoc in Lanka, burning parts of the city, before returning to Rama with news of Sita’s location.</p>
                    <h4>Yuddha Kanda (Book of War)</h4>
                    <p>Rama, along with his allies, builds a bridge (Rama Setu) across the ocean to Lanka. A fierce battle ensues between Rama’s army and Ravana’s forces. Rama eventually kills Ravana and rescues Sita. To prove her chastity, Sita undergoes an ordeal by fire (Agni Pariksha) and emerges unscathed, proving her purity.</p>
                    <h4>Uttara Kanda (Book of the Aftermath)</h4>
                    <p>Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana return to Ayodhya, where Rama is crowned king. Despite Sita’s ordeal, rumors about her chastity continue to spread. To uphold his duty as a king, Rama reluctantly banishes the pregnant Sita to the forest. She finds refuge in the ashram of the sage Valmiki, where she gives birth to twin sons, Lava and Kusha. Many years later, Rama and Sita are reunited when Lava and Kusha sing the Ramayana in his court. Sita, however, chooses to return to the earth, her mother, proving her purity once again.</p>
